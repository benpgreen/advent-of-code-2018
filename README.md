# advent-of-code-2018

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018). For most days, to get answers to a particular day save your puzzle input to a `txt` file and then in the `answers` folder run
```
python day_X.py /path/to/day_X.txt
```
Examples of puzzle inputs can be found in the `inputs` folder. If a puzzle does not have an example puzzle input then the usage of the click command is slightly different (e.g. day 9); see the scripts themselves for information on how to use them.
